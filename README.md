# Implementation-of-RAG-using-Phi-02-model-for-Medical-Chatbot
This project focuses on developing a medical chatbot using the phi-2 language model from Microsoft's Hugging Face Transformers. The goal is to create a conversational interface that assists users with medical queries, providing accurate and helpful responses based on the context provided. The project employs natural language processing techniques, leveraging the llama_index library to index medical documents and facilitate efficient information retrieval. By utilizing the HuggingFaceLLM module, the chatbot is powered by the phi-2 model, specifically designed for medical domain tasks. The chatbot interface is built using Gradio, allowing users to input their medical questions and receive responses generated by the phi-2 model. Additionally, the project integrates text-to-speech functionality using pyttsx3, enabling the chatbot to verbally communicate responses to users. Overall, this project aims to provide a user-friendly and informative medical chatbot that enhances accessibility to medical information and assistance.
